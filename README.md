# Learning HTTP
Working as a web developer means it's good to know as much about how the internet works as possible.

## The HTTP Protocol
* Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol(超文本传输协议)
* It's an <strong>application layer protocol(应用层协议)</strong> that allows web-based applications to communicate(通信) and exchange data(交换数据)
* It's a <strong>TCP/IP based</strong> protocol
* It's used to <strong>deliver contents</strong>, for example, images, videos, audios, documents, etc
* The computers that communicate via the HTTP <strong>must</strong> speak the http protocol

## The HTTPS Protocol
* HTTPS = HTTP + SSL(Secure Socket Layer)
* Cryptography is basically the science of hiding information
* A plain text becomes ciphertext through an encryption algorithm(加密算法) 
* A public key(公钥) is used for encryption(加密) and a private key(私钥) is used for decryption(解密)
* SSL handshake

## Three Important things about the HTTP
* HTTP is a <strong>stateless</strong> protocol
* HTTP is <strong>connectionless</strong>
* HTTP can deliver any sort of data, as long as the two computers are <strong>able to read</strong> it
