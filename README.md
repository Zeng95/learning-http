# Learning HTTP
Working as a web developer means it's good to know <strong>as much about how the internet works as possible</strong>.

## The HTTP Protocol
* Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol(超文本传输协议)
* In standard HTTP, all information is sent in clear text(明文)
* It follows the standard <strong>client-server</strong> model
* It's a <strong>stateless protocol(无状态协议)</strong>
* It's an <strong>application layer protocol(应用层协议)</strong> that allows web-based applications to communicate(通信) and exchange data(交换数据)
* It's a <strong>TCP/IP based protocol(基于TCP传输层)</strong>
* It's used for <strong>delivering contents</strong>. For example, images, videos, audios, documents, etc
* It's <strong>connectionless</strong>
* The computers that communicate via the HTTP <strong>must</strong> speak the http protocol

## The HTTPS Protocol
* Stands for Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol(安全的超文本传输协议)
* HTTPS = HTTP + SSL(Secure Socket Layer)
* Encrypts the data that is being retrieved by HTTP
* Cryptography is basically the science of hiding information
* A plain text becomes ciphertext through an encryption algorithm(加密算法) 
* A public key(公钥) is used for encryption(加密) and a private key(私钥) is used for decryption(解密)
* SSL handshake
