# Learning HTTP
Working as a web developer means it's good to know as much about how the internet works as possible.

## The HTTP Protocol
* It stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol(超文本传输协议)
* It's an <strong>application layer protocol(应用层协议)</strong> that allows web-based applications to communicate and exchange data
* It's a <strong>TCP/IP based</strong> protocol
* It's used to <strong>deliver contents</strong>, for example, images, videos, audios, documents, etc
* The computers that communicate via the HTTP <strong>must</strong> speak the http protocol

## Three Important things about the HTTP
* HTTP is <strong>connectionless</strong>
* HTTP can deliver any sort of data, as long as the two computers are <strong>able to read</strong> it
* HTTP is a <strong>stateless</strong> protocol
